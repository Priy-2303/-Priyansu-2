        <h3>First Time We Talked</h3>
        <p>
          I still remember how nervous I was to say "hi". You replied with that
          calm smile, and I knew we were going to be something special.

        <h3>Funniest Moment</h3>
        <p>
          That day when you said something so stupid in class and then started
          laughing at yourself. The whole classroom was confused but we couldn't stop.

        <h3>When I Respected You Most</h3>
        <p>
          Watching you work hard for something you believed in, even when everyone
          doubted. That's when I realized you're way stronger than you think.

        <h3>One Thing I Regret</h3>
        <p>
          That time I said something mean without thinking. I didn't mean it,
          but I know it hurt. I'm sorry for that, even if you never forgive me.

        <h3>Why You Matter</h3>
        <p>
          Because you're real. No filter, no fake, just honest. In a world full of
          people pretending, you're the one person who never did.

        <h3>What I Miss Most</h3>
        <p>
          Those random moments – you laughing at a stupid joke, your dramatic reactions,
          the way you made everything feel less serious. I miss that version of us.

        <h3>Late Night Talks</h3>
        <p>
          Those 2 AM conversations where we talked about life, dreams, fears –
          things we wouldn't tell anyone else. Those were the realest moments.

        <h3>What I Hope</h3>
        <p>
          That someday you'll think of me and smile instead of angry. That you'll
          remember the good parts and know I still care, even from this distance.

        <h2>One Last Thing</h2>
        <p>
          Every memory here is real. Every line is honest. And every word is
          because you still matter to someone who made mistakes but never stopped
          believing in what we had.
