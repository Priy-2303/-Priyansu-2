          I know things are not fine between us right now, and maybe you are still angry.

          I'm not sending this to force you to forgive me. I just want you to know that this friendship still matters to me.

        <p>
          Whenever you feel ready, I'm here – same old friend, a little more quiet, a lot more sorry.
